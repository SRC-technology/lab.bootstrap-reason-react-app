## This is just the beginning!

We hope you enjoyed this brief lab. It took some effort to put together and we're happy that it has helped you get your first Reason React application up and running with some good practices around it:

* Tests, using a very well known and supported framework like Jest
* Bundling, with the unbelievably fast [Fastpack](https://fastpack.sh) that is written in Reason Native
* Manual namespacing

Some of these are not the default options of other tools, but we have picked them because they have helped us create better quality applications, even if it meant a little more work from us developers.

And that is really why we are here, to build great applications.

## Going forward

Your next steps are likely going to be:

* Adding more tests to the example application we have included here
* Changing the example app for your own app
* Maybe just start your own project from scratch!

Whichever path you take, you can find the ReasonML community gathered in a few places:

* [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/H237nGE), for a chat where most people go to get quick feedback and talk about the ecosystem
* [Discourse Forums](https://reasonml.chat), where you can find discussions that are less ephemeral.

Come join the discussions, we are excited to have you onboard! 🙌🏼

And here's a few useful links for additional reading:

* [ReasonML Official Docs](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/what-and-why)
* [Standard Library Documentation](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js.html) — this is a little rough on the eyes, but we are working with the community to make them gorgeous 💅🏼
* [ReasonML Design Patterns](https://github.com/ostera/reason-design-patterns)
