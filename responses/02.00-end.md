# This is just the beginning! 🥳

We hope you enjoyed this brief lab. It took some effort to put together and we're happy that it has helped you get your first Reason React application up and running.

## Going forward 🚀

Your next steps can be anything really! Here's a few ideas:

* Add more tests to the example application we have included here
* Changing the example app for your own app
* Maybe try to write a Reason project that compiles to native code 🤯

Whichever path you take, you can find the ReasonML community gathered in a few places:

* [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/H237nGE), for a chat where most people go to get quick feedback and talk about the ecosystem
* [Discourse Forums](https://reasonml.chat), where you can find discussions that are less ephemeral.

Come join the discussions, we are excited to have you onboard! 🙌🏼

## Useful Links

And here's a few useful links for additional reading:

* [ReasonML Official Docs](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/what-and-why)
* [Standard Library Documentation](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Js.html) — this is a little rough on the eyes, but we are working with the community to make them gorgeous 💅🏼
* [ReasonML Design Patterns](https://github.com/ostera/reason-design-patterns)
