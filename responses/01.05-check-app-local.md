Hurrah! We're almost done üôå

Everything seems to be in place now, but we haven't verified that the application _runs_. Let's do that.

## :keyboard: Activities

### Step 1.5 ‚Äî Verify Setup üîé

1. Verify app is running by opening `index.html` file locally. On macOS you can run `open index.html`, and on Windows and Linux you should be able to use your web browser to open it.

2. If you see something on the screen that _looks like [this](https://src-technology.github.io/lab-result.bootstrap-reason-react-app/)_ please submit a review to approve this pull request üëç. 

   To submit a review, [head to the **Files changed**](2/files) tab in this pull request, press the big green **Review changes** button, select the **Approve** option and press **Submit review**

   If something looks wrong, or the application does not load at all, please let us know! This could be a bug with the application
   or with the course. You can create an issue using [this link](https://github.com/SRC-technology/lab.intro-to-reason/issues/new?title=%5BSetup%2F1.5%5D%20Something%20went%20wrong&labels=bug&body=Please%20describe%20what%20issue%20you%20are%20having%20with%20this%20step,%20including%20the%20versions%20of%20VSCode,%20the%20Reason%20extension,%20Node,%20and%20feel%20free%20to%20include%20any%20screenshots%20and%20stacktraces%20you%20think%20could%20be%20useful).
