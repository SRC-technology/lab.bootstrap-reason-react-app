Amazing! 👏👏👏

We're getting there. Great 😸 Now we should be able to build our project bundle to serve it on the web.

> NOTE: if you haven't worked with web stuff lately, a _bundle_ is really just a single file that includes most if not all of 
> the source code of the application. It's not _too_ different from the linking process of languages that compile to native.

## :keyboard: Activities!

### Step 1.4 — Build Project 📦

1. In your terminal, build the project by running `yarn build`.

2. You should see in VS Code that a new folder `bundle` has been created, with a single file: `index.js`. This is our compiled project.

3. Add `bundle` to git, commit it, and push it 🏋️‍♀️
