Bravo, @{{ user.username }}! 🤩👏

Now that you have set up the repository with its dependencies, we should set up an editor for you to work in. The Reason community supports several of them, but we have chosen [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) because it has the most polished first-time setup experience.

So let's get it installed in your computer, then lets install the [Reason VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaredly.reason-vscode), and finally browse our code!

## :keyboard: Activities!

### Step 1.1 — Install VS Code 📝

You can get VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com) and it very likely has an installer for your operating system.

After you're done with it, we can install the extension.

### Step 1.2 — Install Reason Extension for VS Code 🛠

You can go to the extension page: [Reason VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaredly.reason-vscode) and you should see a big green button that says _Install_.

After clicking on it, VS Code should show you that the extension is installed and ready to use. If this didn't happen, please check the [Trouble Installing? Page](https://aka.ms/vscode_extn_install). If that also didn't work, feel free to reach out to us on Twitter at [@SRC_technology](https://twitter.com/SRC_technology).

### Step 1.3 — Open Project in VS Code 📂

1. Now that VS Code is open, we can open our project. We can do this by clicking on the File menu, then on Open, and browsing until we find the folder with our `package.json`.

2. Open the `src/model.re` file.

3. If all the steps above worked, we should see on the left that a new `lib` folder appeared. This folder will have all of the compilation output; that is, all the Javascript code.

4. Add `lib`, commit it and push it 🙌
   
   ```
   git add lib
   git commit --message "Add built files from lib folder"
   git push origin setup
   ```
