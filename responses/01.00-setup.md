# Setup

This learning lab has a couple of prerrequisites for you to be able to go through it. Some tooling is going to be needed in your computer:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is the most popular standalone JavaScript runtime and it is required to build [Reason React](INSERT LINK) projects. The Reason language is a dialect of [OCaml](INSERT LINK), and it does not require JavaScript tools when used for binary builds, but for the web, and in particular for Reason React projects, the compilation is done with [BuckleScript](INSERT LINK), an excellent backend for compiling OCaml to JavaScript. The platform for BuckleScript is distributed as an [NPM](INSERT LINK) package, and NPM is part of the Node.js platform.
2. [Visual Studio Code](INSERT LINK) is becoming the most popular editor for web development. It's open source and it works in all major operative systems.
3. The [Reason IDE](INSERT LINK) **TODO**
