### Step 0.0 — Install Node 🚀

If you don't have `node` installed, you can normally get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/

But you may also be able to get it through your package manager of choice:

* on Debian-based Linuxes systems that would look like `apt-get install node`,
* on macOS with Homebrew it would look like `brew install node`,
* on Windows with Choco it looks like `choco install nodejs.install`

But either way, you can just go to the website above, download the installer, and get it set up in a few clicks.

### Step 0.1 — Install Yarn 🧶

Since this course makes some assumptions on the `yarn` tool, we will need to install it.

You can run `npm install --global yarn` to get the latest version of `yarn` globally available, and you
can verify that you have `yarn` installed by running `yarn --version`.

### Step 1.0 — Clone the Project 📦

1. Clone this repo to your computer

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:{{ user.username}}/{{ repo }}
   ```
   
   > If you haven't done this before, we recommend @github's guide on [Cloning Repositories](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository). It is super short and will get you started.

2. Go to the project folder in your computer and check out the `setup` branch. 

   ```
   cd reason-todo-app
   git checkout setup
   ```

2. Run `yarn` to install all necessary dependencies:
   
   ```
   yarn
   ```

   > NOTE: installing dependencies sometimes can take a while and sometimes can fail because the internet is not perfect. If you have any trouble, please try again. If it still doesn't work, tweet at us [@SRC_technology](https://twitter.com/SRC_technology) and we'll try to help! 🙏

3. After the installation is completed, you will have 1 new file (`yarn.lock`) and 1 new folder (`node_modules`). Make sure to add the `yarn.lock` file with `git`, commit it, and push your changes. You can do that by running:

   ```sh
   git add yarn.lock
   git commit --message "Add yarn.lock"
   git push origin setup
   ```
