@{{ user.username }}, you are crushing it 💪

As a token of appreciation, we have set up Github Pages for you, so you can share the results of the course later on. Your app will be available here: https://{{user.sername}}/github.io/{{repo}}/

> NOTE: It may take a few minutes before that link is fully functional, but don't worry, it should be working by the time
> you have finished the course!

So far we have installed everything we needed to get the application running, but although we can see _something_ on the screen, it is not functioning yet. This is the perfect moment for a short break, and when you are ready we can make the app work in this [next PR]({{next_pr}}) 👩‍🔬

I will go make myself a sandwich 🥪
