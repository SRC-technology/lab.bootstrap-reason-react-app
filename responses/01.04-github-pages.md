@{{ user.username }}, you are crushing it 💪

Before we continue, this repository is set up so that when you enable Github Pages you can share the results of the course later on ✨ If you follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages) your app will be available [here](https://{{user.username}}.github.io/{{repo}}/).

So far we have installed everything we needed to get the application running, but although we can see _something_ on the screen, it is not functioning yet.

This is the perfect moment for a short break, and when you are ready we can make the app work in this [next PR]({{next_pr}}) 👩‍🔬

I will go make myself a sandwich 🥪
