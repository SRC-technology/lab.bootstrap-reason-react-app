Fabulous! 🥳

Now we should make sure that even if we change some code, our application is still working well. For that we have included some tests to run.

Let's go ahead and run them 🏃‍♀️ 

## :keyboard: Activities!

### Step 1.5 — Test the Project 🚦

1. In your terminal, run the tests with `yarn test`.

2. You should see a failing test. We need to fix it. This is a small test and it's intentionally failing🙈 but it should be a small change to fix it too!

   You can try removing the `false`, and adding `true` instead.

3. Add `__tests__` to git, commit it, and push it 🏋️‍♀️

   ```
   git add __tests__
   git commit --message "Fix broken test"
   git push origin setup
   ```
