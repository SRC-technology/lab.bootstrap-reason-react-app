# Creating our ToDo app ðŸš€

Now that we have the skeleton of an application up and running, and that we can edit it locally too, we should show the tasks that we have in the state.

We want to:

1. List Tasks
2. Create new tasks
3. Mark existing tasks as done

So let's take those one by one, shall we? ðŸ˜Œ

### Step 2.0 â€” Listing Tasks

For this task, we are to be modifying the Reason source code files. I wrote a couple of comments for you to guide you on what changes we need to do: please follow along with those comments and push the updates that you do into this branch. If you don't remember how to push, don't worry, I will give you the commands for how to do everything that you need. I'll be here checking this pull request and I will give you more instructions after you push.
