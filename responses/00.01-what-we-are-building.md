### What we are building 🔨

We have included a very small ToDo application to serve as an example for yours.
This app has the following features:

1. List tasks
2. Create new tasks
3. Mark existing tasks as done

Sounds good? Great 😸

🌐 You can see a demo of the results [here](https://src-technology.github.io/lab-result.bootstrap-reason-react-app/)
