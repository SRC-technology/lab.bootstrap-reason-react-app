### What we are building 🔨

Before we begin, let's define the features our app will have. Since we are building a ToDo application, we need to be able to:

1. List tasks
2. Create new tasks
3. Mark existing tasks as done

Sounds good? Great 😸

💅 We have some sleek minimalistic CSS in place so no need to worry about styles during this course. But we will cover how to use the power of types for design systems later on!
