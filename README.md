# Bootstrap a Reason React App

> **NOTE**: This is an early alpha of the course that we are iterating on heavily. Please send us your feedback to hi@src.technology or tweet to us at [@SRC_technology](https://twitter.com/SRC_technology).

Hello and welcome to this Learning Lab on Reason where I will walk you through your first Reason project using ReasonReact.

If you have used React.js before you should already know 90% of what you need â€” the course will help you out with the other 10%.

By the end of this course you will have:

ðŸ›  An Editor, set up to work with Reason

ðŸš€ A published ReasonReact application
